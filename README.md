# Analytical Method Assignment

You can access the design doc [here](./docs/Design.md)

## Run the application

run the following commands 
```sh
npm i
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Things to improve
* All the form validations can be done
* Use of `lodash` for accessing and iterating over the objects
* Css Styling üòÅ
* Better state management. Since I am not that familiar with React. I am not sure whether the state management is done in the efficient way.
* Some functions are still defined inside the component function defnitions like handlerFns. It can be moved outside the function defnition which can considerably boost performance in low powered mobile devices.
